I got remaund I have retained your
letter of the 14 of March, and rest much contented
for your good expectation and courage
in all causes that I have these days many ways visited
in, for as you have heard to your old
wont, to escape the hard mislike that the
cause gave by sundry the good notable of your
present care.
I gave a copy of your Latin letter, and took
it in mind to will not only I would in your case

This matter will sound our cause & the same
wholly you wrote to gain the opinion

used in related, and not sent by the parties.
Your blunt (…?) in would hinder the
best after. Your offspring may be reported,
and I hope you gave some occurrence
goes, but I remit that important to be known
and considered of you.
Once partly to reform you wrote your Latin letter

perfect preservation the Elders may be so (…)
[…] […] Poland & supplied to your […]
all the full opponent whereas you shall understand
yourself, for you will no doubt appoint.

And to supply the time upon the good you
rest I think you will do one that the former paid.
In the meantime you may do well to set
the labour upon your profession which may
be added there according to the party your
fall occupy the place, for the matter of

any of your quality as you know.
Gaining understanding for you & that your

Nominated to deliver the cause of your plaint, or
to suggest of your part the effect thereof, to
the party, to inform the order with the hand that
in your patient name (…) all by author=
colour commission, and that seeming to utter
that the latter would be the most course & 
safest way for your patron, in respect of some
examples in (…?) before, the important
matter doubtful of instructions up with
had the beginnings of causes (to persons of your
quality) no personal charge of your intent
allowance (preserving nothing on one
part, but the self-satisfaction & service,
good glory & service), yea no slander to
you the author, and to regard that & that
name, which I assure you would do as it shall,
and if as ample a relation of your patron’s
great work and merits about himself,
could find respect, devoting the party to your

one reason amongst others, that moved us at that…

Time upon to deliver the effect of the cause to
the party you should would the gentle love of
your, whereof would seem no scandal your the
part intend not call you, but remit the same,
to be related to them by property, which will not

these the times. And if your patron command
operative for you must demand C with great
wrong to your servant your & officially

love and affection toward him & his own,

not to defect of your consideration the good or
company distribution of reports which I think
not that to be done, the condition of the delaner
not stinted & the matter itself being considered,
I doubt not that your patron takes it with
well. I may both say & for perfect work you

impart it to him, as favour as you shall
think convenient, in my poor humble and
affectionate offer of my service: and
these being for no use at those times
I take my leave recommending you
to God, wholly protection, from me
