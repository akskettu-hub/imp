Colchester, July 28. 1763.

I received your letter, & acknowledge that
you were very good & generous, & so forth, to write to me so soon.
Your companion in the machine is indeed an excellent man:
the London-hastening part of his character is rather common; but
the other, is rare & curious. He might be said, I think, to play
a good stick; – or a bad stick, if you please; for the fun will be
the same, & it will, I suppose, be nearer the truth into the
bargain. I think there would have been some humour in taking
his cane from him, while he was amusing himself, & laying it
across his back a little, & giving it him again, with a “Sir! I
beg I may not interrupt you.” With a musical stick, one might
be said to beat a man to some tune.

I like the humour of your
avoiding Dr W. because you did not know what to say to him.
When you fall in his way next, & are at a loss for other matter
of conversation, give my service to him, & tell him I hope he
received his Mass safe: I wrote to him indeed about it, &
never received any answer; but you need not say anything.

of that sort to him, lest he shou’d make me amends by writing to
me now.  Moreover – tell him I should take it as a great
favour, if He wou’d let me have a copy of Pergolesi’s Salve
Regina; & if He wou’d employ whom he pleases to transcribe it
at Bristol immediately, that you may bring it away with you:
& tell him you will pay the transcriber; which I suppose you
will be able, without inconvenience, to do, & I will repay your
honour.  The thing, I believe, is not long, & may soon be copied.
If this conversation is not enough, you may proceed to ask
him (from me, & not as from yourself, be sure!) whether
He has yet got Jomelli’s Passion from Italy; & that I
wou’d give the world for a copy of it.  That is a hint, you
know.  If you chuse to moon farther, by talking with a
grave face of things you know nothing of, & in the language
of us connoisseurs, you may tell him, that I have lately
met with the first act of that Oratorio (last-mention’d) &
that it is exquisite!!!!! &c. – There – I think you will
have no occasion to shirk the Doctor again for this next
fortnight; or rather, you may perhaps have more occasion
than ever to shirk him; for I think I have given you a les–

that will puzzle you more than my proposition in Euclid. However,
for your ease & comfort, remember, that the two first articles are
all that I insist on your saying. As to the rest, if it be too hard
for you to get by heart, & if you think you shall not be able to go
through with it without much blundering, & boggling, & slip-slopping
of words, & at last, pulling out your letter, & mooning with it in
the middle of the pump room, you may let it sleep, without much
damage.

Your hypothesis about Mooneries is plausible. Now I
talk of hypotheses, pray have you any philosophical books with
you? what do you read? or do you, like other Gentlemen
in the place, devote your time entirely to mooning?
Pray don’t you think that the man in the moon must moon
inordinately, if one cou’d see him? When you have an Air-pump,
I shall thank my stars that I am not one of the kittens of
your neighbourhood! alas! how many poor, innocent dumb creatures
will have their breath sucked out of their bodies, & dye in vacuo,
to satisfie your rage of experiment! – Let me hear soon, & tell me
what the Doctor says. All were well at home when I heard last.
Pray remember me to Mrs Fitz, for she is a favourite of mine. Do
you trim the loaf as you did last year? – What good company have
you in the house? –

I remain Dear Dan
yrs. affectionately T. T.
