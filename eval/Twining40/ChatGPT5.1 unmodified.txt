What shal I do or say  they tell me you are angry,
very angry, with pauvre moi for not coming to the commemoration.
And then I have been silent so long 
I am a poor unhappy sinner. Do with me whatever
seemeth good. There is my nose, pull it. Here is my
back  kick it. There are my two ears  lug them, or
box them. They are the peccant part; they ought to have
led me up to town, & did not. Well but after you
have beat & kicked & cuffed & caned & cudgelled me at
your pleasure, hear what I have to say for myself. I have
had a very intimate old friend with me some time, whose
name I believe you may have heard  Mr. Elsmoll. He talked of
going to the commemoration with me, but when the time
drew near, he flinched; he has the misfortune to have a
great aversion to London, & if he were to write a Tableau de
de Londres, the picture would not be a bit more amiable
than M. de Merciers Tableau de Paris. Moreover this truly
fond of Music tho he has never fairly got within the
sphere of attraction of this Commemoration business. He is not
particularly fond of the kind of Music. He is more given to
delicate than all to great effects, in Music. He had much rather
hear a single song by Pacchierotti (whom he thoroughly
idolized) than a chorus by a band that would crowd
a Salisbury plain. After some hesitation, he could not bring
himself to go to London. But he left me at perfect liberty, &
even urged me to go. But when I sat down to calculate
my pleasure, I really found that I could not help preferring
home, & a quiet excursion to Harwich &c. with him, to
a London journey, & all that there, without him. And so,
but naïvement, I did what I liked best.  I must, moreover,
confess, that, with respect to myself, the attraction of
the Abbey, was somewhat weakened by the choice of the
Music, which was not to my mind or my palate. Why
the same hackneyed things, over & over & over again,
ad nauseam? Above all  what could induce Bates to
pick out that heavy, monotonous, insipid song, Pious
Orgies? nothing, to me, can be more tiresome.
Well well  Commemorations are in a fair way, &
I shall be in good time for next year. And so lay
aside the terrors of your angry brow, & relax your
stern muscles into a smile. Oh  but I went to
Cambridge with my friend E: & heard Mad. Mara,
for the first time  at Marins benefit. We went on purpose,
give us credit in yr. black books for that, however. She sung,
to me, only two songs; one, I know that my redeemer
liveth, a bravura song of  I forget  but it was a wonderful
exhibition of power of voice, compass, distinctness, rapidity,
& everything that could be in such a song. Our expectations
were fully answered. But  tell it not near the back-
stairs  we wished the other song changed. Yet she
sung it admirably; but it was chosen ad populum I suppose,
not to her own taste. In such a song, I confess I should prefer
Mrs. Bates.  Heard Salomon too, whom I had not heard before.
I like him much better than Cramer. Cramer is very good
mechanian. Salomon played as many hard tricks as the
love of difficulty could wish, but with more appearance
of taste, I think, more tone, more glow, more symptoms
of feeling than Cramer. With my eyes shut, I could tell
that the fiddle was played on by a human creature.

We have been at Ipswich too & heard lessons upon the
P.F. a whole evening  in a comfortable way, by Mrs.
Marshall. She played three lessons. Lately published of
Ogisine, with fiddle accompaniment, which I think
charming music. So are the 3 former, unaccompanied.
Nice! She also played  will you give me leave to
